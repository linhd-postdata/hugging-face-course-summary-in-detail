# Hugging Face Course summary in detail

## Introduction

🤗 This repository contains a summary in detail of the notebooks written in the [Hugging Face course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter0/1?fw=pt). The course is available on the [Hugging Face website](https://huggingface.co). The course is divided into several chapters, and each part has [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) 🍊.

🎯 The two main targets of this project are to add comments on the notebooks to help us to understand in detail the written code and learn how to create comments useful to write code by [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot/) 😻. We hope you enjoy it 🥳.

## Jupyter notebooks

Next, there is a list of the Jupyter notebooks organized by chapters. They have been created following the steps described in the course.

### Chapter 1: **Transformer models**

- Notebook section 3: 🍊 [Transformers, what can they do?](./1_transformer_models/section_3_transformers.ipynb)

### Chapter 2: **Using Transformers**

- Notebook section 2: 🍊 [Behind the pipeline](./2_using_transformers/section_2_pt_pipeline.ipynb).
- Notebook section 3: 🍊 [Models](./2_using_transformers/section_3_pt_models.ipynb).
- Notebook section 4: 🍊 [Tokenizers](./2_using_transformers/section_4_pt_tokenizers.ipynb).
- Notebook section 5: 🍊 [Handling multiple sequences](./2_using_transformers/section_5_pt_multiple_sequences.ipynb).
- Notebook section 6: 🍊 [Putting it all together](./2_using_transformers/section_6_pt_all_together.ipynb).

### Chapter 3: **Fine-tuning a pretrained model**

- Notebook section 2: 🍊 [Processing the data](./3_fine_tunning_a_pretained_model/section_2_pt_processing_data.ipynb).
- Notebook section 3: 🍊 [Fine-tuning a model with the Trainer API](./3_fine_tunning_a_pretained_model/section_3_pt_fine_tuning_trainer_api.ipynb).
- Notebook section 4: 🍊 [A full training](./3_fine_tunning_a_pretained_model/section_4_full_training.ipynb).

### Chapter 4: **Shared models and tokenizers**

- Notebook section 2: 🍊 [Using pretrained models](./4_share_models_and_tokenizers/section_2_pt_pretrained_models.ipynb).

## Run conditions

🚀 The notebooks have been generated in a project created in [Paperspace Gradient](https://gradient.paperspace.com) with Python 3.9.13. The machine used is a P5000 (30GiB RAM 8 CPU 16GiB GPU) (more details on [Paperspace Machines](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/machines/)). The IDE utilized is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) using a remote Jupyter server.

In another hand, as well you can run the notebooks on your local machine or in a cloud service like [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [AWS SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/).

However, we use Paperspace Gradient because it is a good service to run Jupyter notebooks in the cloud. It is very quick and easy to use with Visual Studio Code. We only need to copy a URI to connect to the remote Jupyter server. So we can run your notebooks on a GPU machine. We can use it for free or buy a subscription.

## IDE for coding

A great choice to write code for notebooks is Visual Studio Code on a local machine or in a browser UI. Moreover, we suggest some extensions to improve the experience with Visual Studio Code in quality and productivity:

- 🧞‍♂️ [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)
- 🧞‍♂️ [Excel Viewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GrapeCity.gc-excelviewer)
- 🧞‍♂️ [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)
- 🧞‍♂️ [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme)
- 🧞‍♂️ [Markdown Shortcuts](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mdickin.markdown-shortcuts)
- 🧞‍♂️ [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)
- 🧞‍♂️ [Paste JSON as Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quicktype.quicktype)
- 🧞‍♂️ [Path Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense)
- 🧞‍♂️ [Rainbow CSV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mechatroner.rainbow-csv)

## GitHub Copilot

📚 A lot of articles talk about the benefits of use Copilot in our project. For instance, one of them is [Research: quantifying GitHub Copilot’s impact on developer productivity and happiness](https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/).

That's why the question is, what is the key or secret to use Copilot more and more in our projects? 🤔

Definitely, it is a great tool to improve our productivity. However, we think it is very important to know how to write comments to help Copilot to write better code. So, we suggest paying attention to the comments added to the notebooks for writing better code for NLP (Natural Language Processing) tasks ✅.

## Conclusions

We are excited to see how the Hugging Face environment and the GitHub Copilot tool evolve in the future. Really we believe both are a great combination to create great NLP (Natural Language Processing) projects 💃👏.
